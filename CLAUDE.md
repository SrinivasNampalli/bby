# Load Testing Setup for Vercel Website

## Overview
This directory contains legitimate load testing tools to analyze your website's performance under concurrent user traffic.

## Files Created
- `load_test.py` - Main load testing script using async HTTP requests
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies needed for the test
- `load_test_results.json` - Generated test results (after running)

## Installation

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Load Test
Run a basic test with default settings (5 concurrent users for 30 seconds):
```bash
python load_test.py
```

### Custom Configuration
Edit the configuration in `load_test.py`:
```python
URL = "https://posture-updated.vercel.app/"
CONCURRENT_USERS = 10  # Number of simultaneous users
TEST_DURATION = 60     # Test duration in seconds
```

## What the Test Does

### Legitimate Performance Testing:
- Simulates realistic user behavior with delays between requests
- Measures response times and success rates
- Identifies performance bottlenecks
- Tests server capacity under load
- Generates detailed performance reports

### Metrics Collected:
- Response time statistics (avg, median, min, max)
- Success/failure rates
- Requests per second
- HTTP status code breakdown
- Error analysis

## Interpreting Results

### Good Performance Indicators:
- Response times under 2 seconds
- Success rate above 95%
- Consistent performance across test duration
- No timeout errors

### Performance Issues to Watch:
- Increasing response times over test duration
- High error rates (4xx/5xx status codes)
- Timeouts or connection errors
- Memory/CPU spikes on server

## Best Practices

### Responsible Testing:
- Start with low concurrent users (5-10)
- Use realistic request patterns
- Test during off-peak hours
- Monitor server resources
- Respect rate limits

### Gradual Load Increase:
```python
# Example: Progressive load testing
for users in [5, 10, 20, 50]:
    tester = LoadTester(URL, users, 60)
    await tester.run_test()
    time.sleep(30)  # Cool-down period
```

## Vercel Considerations

- Vercel has automatic scaling but testing helps understand limits
- Edge caching may affect results - test both cached and uncached content
- Serverless functions have cold start delays
- Monitor Vercel dashboard during tests

## Next Steps for Performance Optimization

1. **Analyze Results**: Look for patterns in slow requests
2. **Optimize Assets**: Compress images, minify CSS/JS
3. **Implement Caching**: Use proper cache headers
4. **CDN Optimization**: Leverage Vercel's edge network
5. **Database Optimization**: If using external APIs/databases

## Important Notes

- This is for **legitimate performance testing only**
- Do not use for artificial traffic inflation
- Results help identify real performance issues
- Use insights to improve actual user experience
